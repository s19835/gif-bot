- Initialising the Git repository.

        ```bash
        # when running the .js file throw node
        node --env-file .env index.js
        ```

  - Or if itâ€™s a simple data or small amount then use with node as shown below,

        ```bash
        A=123 B=456 DISCORD_TOKEN=your-token-goes-here node index.js
        ```

- Have some struggle with the url fetching

    I tried to straightly add the url as a response thinking it will automatically get the media but, we first need to use node-fetch module to fetch the data from the url from web through http request, then change the format to json. Even after we need to specify the straight link for the media.

  ## Direct Image URLs vs. Embed URLs

  - Direct Image URLs (json.data[0].images.original.url):

        These URLs directly point to the image file (in this case, a GIF).
        When sent in a Discord message, Discord fetches the image and displays it inline as an embedded image.
        Example: [https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEjI6SIIHBdRxXI40/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEjI6SIIHBdRxXI40/giphy.gif)

  - Embed URLs (json.data[0].embed_url):

        These URLs point to a Giphy page that contains the GIF and other metadata.
        Discord treats these as standard URLs and does not always auto-embed them as images.
